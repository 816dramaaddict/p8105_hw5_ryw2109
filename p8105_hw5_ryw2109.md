Given a function that computes the probability that at least two people
share a birthday for a fixed group size between 2 and 50, after running
10,000 times, the probability of shared birthdays as the group size
increase is shown above.

    ## stat_identity: na.rm = FALSE

The power increases for effect sizes 0 to 4, however, for effect sizes 4
to 6, the power stayed relatively similar. The increase of power was
greatest for effect size 1 to 3. With the increase in effect size, there
is an increase of power, which in turn indicates higher probability of
rejecting the null hypothesis.

The sample average ùúá across tests for which the null is rejected is not
approximately equal to the true value of ùúá. This may be due to sample
variability and Type I error.
